  New passengers tend to travel more on weekends, particularly Saturdays and Sundays, contributing to a 15% increase in trips during these days.
  
- **Business-Focused Cities See Longer Trips**  
  Cities like Bengaluru and Hyderabad show longer average trip durations and higher fares, suggesting that these cities are more business-oriented.
